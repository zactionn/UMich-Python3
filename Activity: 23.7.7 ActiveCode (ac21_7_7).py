"Below, we have provided a species list and a population list. Use zip to combine these lists into one list of tuples called pop_info. From this list, create a new list called endangered that contains the names of species whose populations are below 2500."

population = [10000, 90000, 1000, 2000000, 500000, 500, 1200, 8000, 12000, 2300, 7500, 100, 1800, 9500, 125000]
